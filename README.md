I changed <tile>Horiseon</tile> instead of <tile>website</tile>

I deleted the following: Hori and this code: <span class="seo">seo</span>  and changed it to this code: <h1>Horiseon</h1>

I changed the folowing: <div class="search-engine-optimization"> to this:<div id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization"> so when you click on it, it will take you to the section on the webpage.
